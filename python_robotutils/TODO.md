# TODOs and Open Issues for the Python robotutils package

#Plan
1. Port ConfigurationHelper and ConfigurationHelperTest:
	- Goes under robotutils/misc config_helper.py, test_config_helper.py
2. [BIG!] StructuredLogger and part of StructuredLoggerTest (the part that doesn't use
	LoggerUtils).
	- Goes under robotutils/logger (haven't decided module names yet)
3. LoggerUtils and LoggerUtilsTest - the latter includes some test functionality not yet
	ported over from StructuredLoggerTest.
	- Goes under robotutils/logger (haven't decided module names yet)
